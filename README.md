## Assigment Week #3 - Concurrency in Go - THREADS IN GO

## Instructions

The goal of this activity is to explore the use of threads by creating a program for sorting integers that uses four goroutines to create four sub-arrays and then merge the arrays into a single array.

Write a program to sort an array of integers. The program should partition the array into 4 parts, each of which is sorted by a different goroutine. Each partition should be of approximately equal size. Then the main goroutine should merge the 4 sorted subarrays into one large sorted array.

The program should prompt the user to input a series of integers. Each goroutine which sorts Â¼ of the array should print the subarray that it will sort. When sorting is complete, the main goroutine should print the entire sorted list.

Resulting slice of integers sorted in Thread #1: [-1000 -1 234 453]
Resulting slice of integers sorted in Thread #2: [45 58 90 257]
Resulting slice of integers sorted in Thread #3: [-987 -34 0 12]
Resulting slice of integers sorted in Thread #4: [-234 45 123 125 789]

After merging all that slices, the initial slice of integers now contains: [-1000 -1 234 453 45 58 90 257 -987 -34 0 12 -234 45 123 125 789]

The resulting slice of integers, once sorted, now contains: [-1000 -987 -234 -34 -1 0 12 45 45 58 90 123 125 234 257 453 789]
